            <p>Spaghetti and meatballs is a classic Italian-American dish consisting of spaghetti, tomato sauce, and meatballs.<br>
                It is a staple of Italian-American cuisine, and is often served as a main course or as a side dish.<br>
                The dish is typically made with spaghetti noodles, tomato sauce, and meatballs, but there are many variations of the dish that include different types of pasta, sauces, and meats.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>1/2 pound ground veal</li>
                <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups lukewarm water</li>
                <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 (28 ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley,
                    salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time.
                    The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs.
                    (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is
                    very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel.
                    (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that
                    they hold their shape better.)</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, saute onions and garlic in olive oil until
                    onion is translucent. Stir in bay leaf, oregano, and parsley. Stir in tomato sauce
                    and diced tomatoes. Add meatballs and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Cook spaghetti according to package directions. Drain. Serve meatballs and sauce
                    over spaghetti.</li>
            </ol>
